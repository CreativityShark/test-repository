    <h1>GETTING IN</h1>
    <div class="box">
      <p>Closing the distance is one of Potemkin's big challenges. He's not as mobile as other characters, and his movement options have weaknesses that can give the opponent an opportunity. This makes choosing how you get past <a href="https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Neutral#:~:text=The%20Fighting%20Game%20Glossary%20by%20Infil&text=The%20stage%20of%20a%20fight,start%20or%20continue%20your%20gameplan.">neutral</a> into Pot Buster range very important.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h2>WALKING</h2>
      <p>The most straightforward approach is to just... y'know. Hold forward.</p>
      <p>This is the slowest option to get in (Potemkin doesn't have a run or forward dash), but it also leaves your options open. You can walk, you can jump, you can take advantage of Pot's massive normal attacks, etc. This should be your default option when a better option doesn't present itself.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h2>HAMMER FALL</h2>
      <p>Second only to walking, Hammer Fall should be one of your most common methods of approach. It's Pot's fastest way of getting in, especially if you start holding back during another move's animation so you can immediately Hammer Fall once you're done recovering. Hammer Fall also has armor, which allows you to push through single attacks.</p>

      <p>Use Hammer Fall to close the gap after moves that cause a knock down and have a lot of recovery frames like Slide Head or Pot Buster, and brake just before the opponent so you can immediately threaten a <a href="strat.html">50/50</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h2>MEGAFIST</h2>

      <p>The height that Megafist gives you is helpful for jumping over enemy attacks, but the knockback when it connects can end up creating more distance for you to cover. This is less of a problem at the edges of the stage. Megafist also doesn't cover as much ground as other options, but that can be remedied using a Kara cancel (covered later).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h2>HEAT TACKLE</h2>

      <p>Heat Tackle covers a lot of ground and has armor like Hammer Fall, but can knock the opponent too far and leaves you vulnerable when it doesn't connect. Can be useful if the opponent is in the air, but otherwise opt for one of Pot's other options.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <h2>KARA CANCELS</h2>
      <p>In Guilty Gear, some normal attacks can be cancelled into special moves during their startup (the part of the animation before you actually start attacking). Some moves like Pot's 6K (Holding forward and pressing Kick) also have some forward velocity that carries over even after their cancelled. Cancelling 6K into one of Pot's specials is called <a href="https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Neutral#:~:text=The%20Fighting%20Game%20Glossary%20by%20Infil&text=The%20stage%20of%20a%20fight,start%20or%20continue%20your%20gameplan.">Kara Cancelling</a>, and while Kara Cancelling is hard, requiring some precisely timed inputs, it can be a very useful tool for getting a little more range out of Pot's specials.</p>
      <p>Kara Cancelling a forwards Megafist, for example, lets the move cover a lot more distance than it would otherwise. Kara Cancelling moves with short ranges like Garuda Impact or Pot Buster allows you to use these moves more flexibly, even to where Potemkin can hit a Pot Buster at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqXbTOYKjvI">the start of the round</a>.</p>
